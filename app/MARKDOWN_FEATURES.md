# Markdown Usage Guide

Markdown is enabled in profile and project text fields. Keep it readable and restrained.

## Where Markdown Is Used

- Photographer bio (`/dashboard/profile`)
- Project description and notes (`/dashboard/projects/[id]`)
- Photo captions
- Admin-managed long-form text fields

## Supported Basics

```md
## Heading

Regular paragraph text with **bold** and *italic*.

- Bullet one
- Bullet two

1. Step one
2. Step two

> Pull quote

[Link text](https://example.com)
```

## Writing Guidelines

- Prefer short paragraphs.
- Use headings to break sections.
- Use lists for facts, not for storytelling.
- Avoid excessive emphasis (too much bold/italic gets noisy).
- Add context: who/where/why, not just what.

## Caption Pattern That Works

Use this order when possible:

1. What is happening
2. Who is in frame (if permission/public context allows)
3. Where in town
4. Why it matters

Example:

```md
Tom closes his repair shop on Main Street after the last customer leaves.

He has worked this same counter for 34 years. Most of his customers now drive in from nearby towns because similar shops have closed.
```

## Editorial Rules

- No private personal details without consent.
- Keep language factual and specific.
- Links should have descriptive text (not “click here”).
- Proofread before publishing.
