# Markdown Features for Photographers

The Small Town Gallery supports **Markdown** formatting throughout the platform, allowing photographers to create rich, formatted content for their profiles, projects, and photo captions.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters. It's easy to learn and makes your content look professional without needing complex tools.

## Where Can I Use Markdown?

### 1. Photographer Bio (`/dashboard/settings`)
Tell your story! Include:
- Your background in photography
- Why you're interested in documentary work
- What draws you to small towns
- Links to your portfolio or social media

### 2. Project Descriptions (`/dashboard/projects/[id]`)
For each town you document, you can write:
- **Description**: Overall vision and goals for the project
- **Notes**: Field notes, process reflections, challenges, memorable moments

### 3. Photo Captions (Upload interface)
Every photo can have:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Caption**: Full story behind the image (markdown supported!)
- **Location**: Specific location within the town

### 4. Town Pages (Admin only)
Admins can write rich content about towns:
- **Description**: Overview of the town
- **History**: Historical context and background

## Markdown Syntax Guide

### Headers
```markdown
# Main Heading (H1)
## Sub Heading (H2)
### Smaller Heading (H3)
```

**When to use:**
- H2 for main sections in your bio or project description
- H3 for subsections
- Avoid H1 (page already has main title)

---

### Emphasis

```markdown
**Bold text** or __Bold text__
*Italic text* or _Italic text_
***Bold and italic*** or ___Bold and italic___
```

**When to use:**
- Bold for emphasis or key terms
- Italic for quotes, thoughts, or subtle emphasis

---

### Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[My Portfolio](https://mywebsite.com)
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/username)
```

**When to use:**
- Link to your portfolio or social media in bio
- Reference sources or context in project descriptions
- External links open in new tab automatically

---

### Lists

**Unordered (bullet points):**
```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item (indent with 2 spaces)
  - Another nested item
```

**Ordered (numbered):**
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

**When to use:**
- List key themes in your project
- Enumerate technical details (camera, lens, settings)
- Break up long paragraphs

---

### Quotes

```markdown
> This is a quote
> It can span multiple lines
```

**Renders as:**
> This is a quote
> It can span multiple lines

**When to use:**
- Quote someone you photographed
- Pull out an important thought or observation
- Highlight memorable conversations

---

### Line Breaks

```markdown
Single line break doesn't create space.
This appears on the same line.

Blank line creates a new paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.
```

**When to use:**
- Separate paragraphs for readability
- Give visual breathing room

---

### Code or Technical Details

```markdown
Inline code: `Canon 5D Mark IV`
```

**When to use:**
- Technical specs: `f/2.8, 1/250s, ISO 400`
- Camera/lens model names
- GPS coordinates

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Photographer Bio

```markdown
## About Me

I'm a documentary photographer based in **Carbondale, Illinois**, currently pursuing my MFA in Cinema and Photography at Southern Illinois University.

My work focuses on:
- Rural American communities
- Everyday moments that define place
- The intersection of tradition and change

I believe small towns hold stories that deserve to be told. Through photography, I aim to capture the authentic character of these communities—not as they're imagined, but as they truly are.

When I'm not photographing, you can find me developing film in the darkroom or teaching photography workshops.

### Example 2: Project Description

```markdown
## Carbondale, 2024

*A semester documenting my adopted hometown*

I spent fall 2024 photographing Carbondale, the town where I've lived for three years but never truly *seen*. This project challenged me to look beyond campus and discover the layers beneath the surface.

### Approach

- Weekly visits to local businesses, capturing daily routines
- Attended community events from farmers markets to city council meetings
- Focused on intergenerational connections

### Themes

The project explores:
- **Transition**: A college town in constant flux
- **Community**: How neighbors support each other
- **Identity**: What makes Carbondale distinct

> "Everyone knows everyone here. That's both beautiful and complicated." — Local business owner

This work taught me that documentary photography isn't about being an outsider looking in—it's about building relationships and earning trust.
```

### Example 3: Photo Caption

```markdown
**Saturday Morning at the Farmers Market**

Mary Johnson has been selling vegetables at the Carbondale Farmers Market for 32 years. She grows everything on her family's farm just outside town.

When I asked what keeps her coming back every Saturday, she said: *"The people. It's not about the money—it's about seeing the same faces, watching kids grow up, being part of something."*

This was shot on a foggy October morning, the kind where everything feels soft and quiet. I love how the morning light catches the condensation on the produce.

`Shot on: Canon 5D Mark IV, 50mm f/1.4, ISO 800`
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ **Be authentic** - Write in your own voice
✅ **Tell stories** - Share the human moments behind the images
✅ **Provide context** - Help viewers understand what they're seeing
✅ **Use formatting sparingly** - Don't overdo bold/italic
✅ **Break up text** - Use paragraphs and lists for readability
✅ **Proofread** - Use the preview feature before saving

### Don't:
❌ Don't use ALL CAPS (comes across as shouting)
❌ Don't over-format (too many bolds/italics is distracting)
❌ Don't write huge walls of text (break into paragraphs)
❌ Don't share personal info about subjects without permission
❌ Don't use offensive or inappropriate language

## Tips for Photo Captions

Great photo captions often include:

1. **The "What"**: What's happening in the image?
2. **The "Who"**: Who are the people (if they gave permission)?
3. **The "Where"**: Specific location within the town
4. **The "Why"**: Why this moment matters
5. **The "How"**: Your process or technical approach (optional)

**Short example:**
```markdown
Tom repairs a customer's shoes at his shop on Main Street. He's been doing this work for 40 years, and says he can tell a lot about a person by their shoes.
```

**Longer example:**
```markdown
The Homecoming Parade has been a tradition in Vienna for over 75 years. I photographed this from the second-floor window of the old bank building, trying to capture the entire procession down Main Street.

The perspective shows how the whole town comes out for this—people lining both sides, businesses closed for the afternoon, generations gathering together. This is the kind of event that defines small-town life.

*Note: This was one of those perfect documentary moments—I didn't direct anything, just waited for the right composition as the parade passed by.*
```

## Accessibility Notes

When writing captions:

- Avoid relying solely on color descriptions
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Keep language clear and straightforward

Remember: Your captions help visually impaired visitors experience your photography through your words.
