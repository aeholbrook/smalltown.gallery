	<p>Pomona is an unincorporated community in Jackson County, Illinois. Pomona is located in the Shawnee National Forest 10 miles south of Murphysboro. The town’s story dates to 1875, when Pomona was named and its post office was established. It had been settled in the 1830’s. The town remained largely isolated until a civilian conservation corps project in the 1930’s carved a dirt road down off Illinois 127 to the town.</p>
	<p>Pomona is historically known for its general store, that was built in 1876 when Pomona was a railroad town and a shipping point for produce. The original wooden store burned down in 1915. A rebuilt store burned in 1917, and a brick store was built the same year to replace it. The store now sits as a vintage looking way to remember the town’s history. </p>
	<p>Pomona is also home to the Pomona Natural Bridge. The bridge is prefaced by a short looping hiking trail which leads to a view of the natural bridge from above. The bridge itself is made of sandstone and millions of years of erosion and spans 90 feet. </p>
	<p>I knew nothing about Pomona before embarking on this project. I picked the town because I wanted a town that was very landscape centric, and Pomona fit the category quite like no other town I had researched. The town itself sits in a valley, giving it a rather different looking feel geographical wise, and I used the geography of the town to my advantage in my photographs whenever I could. While this year was very different in terms of people I could talk to, I’d like to thank Paul Jacobs, the recently elected State Representative for District 115, for all his help that he provided to me during this project.</p>
