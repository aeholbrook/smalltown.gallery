<p>Omaha, Illinois is located inside one of Illinois' smallest counties with Omaha itself only having a population of 290 people. The Village of Omaha was established in 1871 as a stop along the Springfield and Illinois South Eastern Railway. </p><p>A baggage master working for the railroad, Henry Pearce, named the settlement for Omaha, Nebraska, where he had previously worked as a baggage master. Omaha Illinois, oddly enough, is best known for a furniture store, Omaha furniture helping customers from Illinois and numerous neighboring states.</p><p>
I knew nothing about Omaha before I started this project. I have never really seen, to my knowledge, a town so small and what the appeal was to live there. But, throughout my project I have met some incredible people, some of whom left the city life to live a more debt free life in rural Illinois. </p><p>I also had my fair share of not so good experiences realizing that small towns can be very protective of their town and ways and get paranoid when a stranger arrives flashing a camera around their faces, homes, and businesses. </p><p>Either way, there were plenty of people excited to share the history and stories of their town.</p>
