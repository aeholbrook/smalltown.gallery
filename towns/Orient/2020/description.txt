<p>Orient, Illinois is a small about 40 minutes away from the SIU campus.</p><p>The town has a population of a little over 300 people. <p>The town's history consists of it being a major coal mining town, but as of today none of the mines are still in use and the town has shrunk in size considerably.</p><p> The photos I have shared depict some of the important landmarks in the town, such as one of the old coal mines which was filled with concrete in the 1990s.</p><p> Some of the other pictures include a few well-known members of the community, one of which is 93 years old and has lived there his whole life. Overall, the town has changed a lot since itâ€™s heyday but there is still plenty of activity throughout and the people are very close to one another.
