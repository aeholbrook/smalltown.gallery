Located along IL-127 between Murphysboro and Pinckneyville, resides a small village named Vergennes. This town was originally settled by a group of pioneers with the surname of Tuthill, in the northwestern corner of Jackson county near Beaucoup Creek. When the railroad was built through Illinois, the town was moved closer to the railroad.

In its heyday, the town had an inn, gas station, grocery store, and several other businesses. However, Vergennes suffered two major fires involving several of these establishments. Unfortunately, most of these businesses were not able to make a comeback after these tragedies. Currently functioning are two Methodist churches, the Doerr Action house, the Case dealership, the Banking center, the post office, and the community center. The Elverado grade school currently meets in what used to be the Vergennes high school.

The Vergennes volunteer Fire Department functions on an annual budget of $8,000 and serves the community and approximately a 300-square mile radius, according to volunteer firefighter and emergency medical responder, as well as the Village of Vergennes office manager Trish Sherman. Fire Chief Shannon Clark, shared about the department’s dive rescue unit and the new truck that was donated to the department this fall.

When I was visiting towns in southern Illinois for this project, Vergennes appealed to me because of its proximity to Carbondale, as well as its aesthetic. The town also had two churches, both United Methodist, which intrigued me because I grew up in the Methodist tradition. I also thought that it was interesting that they had such a large fire department, and I thought that the park in the middle of town made the town feel very homey.

I would like to thank the citizens of Vergennes for welcoming me into their community, and allowing me to make photographs. I would like to offer special thanks to several people. First, the town’s unofficial historian, long time major, and former fire chief, Don Wisely for sharing his extensive knowledge of the town and its history with me. Next, the fire chief Shannon Clark for sharing information about the fire department and allowing me to photograph a training exercise. I would also like to thank, the Siebert’s, Allen Bigham, and Kaley Graff for all of their help navigating and documenting the town. This project was made possible by these and many other individuals and would not have been this successful without the help and cooperation of the community.
