<p><em>A note from the photographer:</em></p>

<p>To the Belknap locals,</p>

<p>I would like to thank the people of Belknap for welcoming me into their town and allowing me to be a part of their daily lives. It has truly been an eye-opening experience getting to make the 
beautiful drive to Belknap each week. Every time I stepped foot in Belknap, I learned or saw something new. I have loved meeting all of the Belknap locals and I hope to keep in touch. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I have loved putting it together!</p>

<p>To the Small Town Documentary professor, Dan Overturf:</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for guiding my fellow classmates and I throughout our semester in each of our chosen small towns. Thank you for pushing us to always show our best work and encouraging us to get out and make photographs in the rollercoaster year of 2020. This course was, in many ways, one of my favorite experiences at SIU. Thank you again!</p>
