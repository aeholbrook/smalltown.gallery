Ozark, Illinois is located in Johnson County and in the Shawnee National Forest.  Ozark is listed with a population of 900, but the people of this unincorporated community would say there are about 50 people.  The area is made up mostly of farmland with horses, cattle, and other livestock.

Ozark used to be a big orchard town with the railroad going through.  There also used to be a bank and a hotel in Ozark.  Now there is not so much going on.  Camp Ondessonk, a Catholic youth camp, a Pentecostal church, and a Baptist church are located in the middle of Ozark, along with their post office.  Located just outside of Ozark is a BBQ restaurant, Murphy’s Pit BBQ, and an overnight rental, called the Potel.

The Shawnee National Forest has many hiking trails, several of which are close to Ozark.  Jackson Falls is very popular among rock climbers because of the scenic cliffs.  Bell Smith Springs is another scenic area with trails, many rock formations, and canyons.   Murphy’s Pit BBQ is very popular among the campers and hikers visiting these sites.

I am also from a small town so I could relate to most of the people in Ozark.  I understand how weird it is for someone you do not know to come into your town with a camera and start taking pictures.  Everyone I met was really nice and helpful with what I needed for my project.  I enjoyed learning about Ozark and meeting new people throughout this project.
